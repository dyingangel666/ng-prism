# @ng-prism/plugin-visual-regression

Visual regression plugin for [@ng-prism/core](https://github.com/dyingangel666/ng-prism). Reads a per-variant screenshot comparison report at build time and renders it inside the styleguide — so diffs live next to the component they belong to instead of in a CI log.

> **Full documentation:** [ng-prism Docs — Visual Regression Plugin](https://dyingangel666.github.io/ng-prism/#/plugins/visual-regression)

The plugin **only renders a report someone else produced.** It performs no image comparison of its own — that belongs to your runner, which owns the baselines and the pinned container. See [Visual Regression Testing](https://dyingangel666.github.io/ng-prism/#/guide/visual-regression) for how to capture screenshots that do not flake, including the `?capture=1` isolation mode.

## Installation

```bash
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-visual-regression
```

Or manually: `npm install @ng-prism/plugin-visual-regression`

### Peer Dependencies

| Package          | Version     |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `@ng-prism/core` | `^22.1.4-0` |
| `@angular/core`  | `>=20.0.0`  |

## Setup

```typescript
// ng-prism.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@ng-prism/core/config';
import { visualRegressionPlugin } from '@ng-prism/plugin-visual-regression';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    visualRegressionPlugin({
      reportPath: 'coverage/my-lib/vrt-report.json',
      assetBaseUrl: 'assets/',
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Options

| Option         | Default             | Description                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reportPath`   | `'vrt-report.json'` | Path to the report JSON, relative to the workspace root.                           |
| `assetBaseUrl` | `''`                | Prefix applied to the image paths in the report so they resolve against the build. |
| `thresholds`   | `{ score: 100 }`    | Minimum score before the header badge stops being green.                           |

## Report Format

```jsonc
{
  "total": {
    "auditedVariants": 85,
    "auditedComponents": 10,
    "unchanged": 84,
    "changed": 1,
    "sizeMismatch": 0,
    "new": 0,
    "maxDiffRatio": 0.5,
    "score": 99
  },
  "byVariant": [
    {
      "className": "ButtonComponent",
      "variantName": "Primary",
      "variantIndex": 0,
      "status": "changed",
      "diffRatio": 0.5,
      "baselinePath": "vrt/baseline/ButtonComponent/00-primary.png",
      "currentPath": "vrt/current/ButtonComponent/00-primary.png",
      "diffPath": "vrt/diff/ButtonComponent/00-primary.png",
      "bg": "light",
      "baselineBg": "light"
    }
  ]
}
```

Results are matched to components by `className`. All three image paths are optional and the panel degrades gracefully: baseline + current gives a wipe comparison, baseline + diff falls back to comparing against the diff mask, and a single image is shown on its own.

`status: "new"` — a variant with no baseline yet — renders as a **neutral** state, never as a failure.

`bg` and `baselineBg` are optional and record the canvas background a capture was taken on — `bg` for this run, `baselineBg` for the stored baseline. A runner gets `bg` for free: it is the resolved `bg` on the variant it already read from `__PRISM_MANIFEST__`. Given them, the panel frames the images in that surface instead of the transparency checkerboard (which is what makes a dark variant's diff mask readable), and when the two differ it names the background change rather than leaving a 100% diff unexplained.

## Serving the Images

The report references images by path; those files must be reachable from the built styleguide. Copy them in via the `assets` array of your Prism app's build target, then point `assetBaseUrl` at where they land.

`assetBaseUrl` is **prepended to the path in the report** — it is not a replacement for it. The three values have to line up:

```jsonc
// angular.json — my-lib-prism build target
"assets": [
  { "glob": "**/*", "input": "vrt", "output": "assets/vrt" }
]
```

| Recorded in the report | `assetBaseUrl` | Requested URL                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `vrt/baseline/x.png`   | `assets/`      | `assets/vrt/baseline/x.png` ✅ |
| `vrt/baseline/x.png`   | `vrt/`         | `vrt/vrt/baseline/x.png` ❌    |
