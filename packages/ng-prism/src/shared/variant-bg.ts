/**
 * The surface a variant is reported to render on when nothing declares one.
 *
 * `transparent`, because an undeclared variant has no opinion about its
 * surface. `checker` patterns over `--prism-bg-surface`, a theme token, and
 * capture mode keeps the colour, so the runner's theme would leak into the
 * baseline. Alpha has no such dependency and, unlike a pattern, does not shift
 * when a centred component resizes. In the app both render the same
 * checkerboard; the difference only shows in a capture.
 *
 * A runner must pass `omitBackground: true`, otherwise the capture is opaque
 * over whatever the browser painted. See
 * `docs/guide/visual-regression.md#capturing-transparency`.
 *
 * What to declare:
 *
 * - `light` or `dark` when the component was designed against a surface. Their
 *   colours are absolute, not theme tokens, so they are stable across runners.
 * - `transparent` when the component's own transparency is under test (an
 *   outlined button, an icon, a divider). On an opaque colour a transparent
 *   fill and a painted fill produce the same pixels.
 * - `dots`, `plain` or `checker` for browsing. They follow the active theme, so
 *   a baseline recorded on one is only as stable as the theme.
