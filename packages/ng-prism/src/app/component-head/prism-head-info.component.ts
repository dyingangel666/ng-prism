/**
 * Identity disclosure for the component head.
 *
 * Selector, description and tags all answer "what is this component" — a
 * question you read once on arrival and never again while building. Keeping
 * them permanently on screen cost a 128px band to say something that belongs
 * behind one glyph.
 *
 * Opening is click-only, through the native Popover API. Escape, click-outside
 * dismissal and top-layer placement come with it declaratively; a hover panel
 * would mean rebuilding all three by hand, and crossing the gap between icon
 * and card without the card closing is its own problem.
