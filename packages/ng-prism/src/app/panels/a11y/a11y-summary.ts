/**
 * A component's standing, derived with the same precedence
 * `checkA11yThresholds` uses library-wide.
 *
 * Browser-safe and deliberately so, even though the build step is its main
 * caller: the derivation is written down once and read from both sides. The
 * build-time hook stores the result in the component's meta for the navigation
 * marker, and the panel tab grades the *live* audit with the very same rule.
 * The two look at different numbers — the report is a snapshot, the audit is
 * running now — but they must never grade the same number differently, which
 * is what a second hardcoded scale next to this one would guarantee.
