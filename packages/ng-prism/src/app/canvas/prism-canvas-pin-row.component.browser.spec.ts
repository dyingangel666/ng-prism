/**
 * Replaces the real `PrismIconComponent` module with a classic-decorator
 * double wherever it is imported in this test file.
 *
 * `name`/`size` on the real component are signal inputs (`input.required()`,
 * `input()`). This workspace's specs are transpiled by SWC and compiled by
 * Angular's JIT compiler at test time rather than by `ngtsc`, and JIT has no
 * static analysis pass over the class to discover signal-input fields — see
 * `project_jit_test_limitation`. The symptom is exactly `NG0303` on `[size]`
 * followed by `NG0950` once the icon's own constructor effect reads `name()`
 * with nothing bound yet. No existing TestBed render in this codebase
 * exercises a signal-input child, for the same reason.
 *
 * `jest.mock` hoists this call above every statement in the file, including
 * this file's own `import` of `@angular/core` — a top-level reference to
 * `Component`/`Input` from that import would still be in its temporal dead
 * zone the moment this factory runs, which is why they are `require`d here
 * instead, and why the double is declared inside the factory rather than
 * closed over from the module scope.

 * pulls in `PrismIconComponent`, whose resources live under `../icons/`, so
 * a resolver that only joins against this spec's own `__dirname` (which is
 * all a single pinned component needs) resolves the icon's URL to a path
 * under `canvas/` that does not exist. Searching the whole `app` tree by
 * basename works regardless of which component declared the URL.
