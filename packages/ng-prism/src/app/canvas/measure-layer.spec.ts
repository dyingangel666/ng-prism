/**
 * Where the measuring overlay sits in the stage's stack, and why it is not
 * free to move.
 *
 * The overlay shipped with no `z-index` at all, which is the one value it
 * cannot have. `.demo-wrap` is `position: relative` with a `transform` — a
 * stacking context of its own — and renders *after* `<prism-canvas-measure />`
 * in `prism-renderer.component.html`, so at `z-index: auto` the two are
 * painted in tree order and `.demo-wrap` wins. Every line and label over the
 * specimen was hidden behind it, every `pointerdown` over the specimen landed
 * on it instead of on the overlay, and alt-click anchoring — which by
 * definition requires clicking *on* an element — could not be entered at all.
 *
 * The naive repair trades that for a different bug, which is why the ceiling
 * below is asserted as hard as the floor: this is the only overlay on the
 * stage that takes pointer events across its whole area. Raised past the
 * background pill it covers that pill's Reset button, the failure `.vp-grip`
 * already documents; raised past the toolrail it covers the very button that
 * switches the tool off again.
 *
 * None of it is observable under jsdom — no layout, no paint, no hit testing —
 * so it is asserted against the source text, the way `viewport-css.spec.ts`
 * and `canvas-overlay-offsets.spec.ts` assert their own CSS invariants.
