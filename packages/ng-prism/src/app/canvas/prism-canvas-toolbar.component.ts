/**
 * The canvas tools, as a rail floating over the canvas.
 *
 * Things you toggle constantly (guides, rulers, the viewport constraint) get
 * their own button; things you set once (background, zoom, viewport width) live
 * in the menu. The template is a view rather than a setting and keeps its own
 * button. Zoom and the active viewport width are shown as readouts; the width
 * only appears while the viewport constraint is on.
 *
 * The host generates no box. The rail must be a direct child of
 * `.prism-canvas-wrap` outside the stage, because that is what capture mode's
 * structural rule in `prism-capture.service.ts` hides. A rail nested in the
 * renderer or the stage would end up in every screenshot and corrupt
 * visual-regression baselines.
