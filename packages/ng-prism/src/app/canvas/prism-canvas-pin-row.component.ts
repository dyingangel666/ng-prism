/**
 * The pinned measurements, as a row below the canvas.
 *
 * Not a panel in a corner of the stage: the top overlay band already carries
 * the background pill on the left, the viewport dimension line in the
 * middle and the toolrail on the right. A fourth floating surface there
 * would be the first one to collide with another.
 *
 * A direct child of `.prism-canvas-wrap` and therefore without a capture
 * guard of its own: `CAPTURE_CANVAS_ONLY_SELECTOR` structurally removes
 * every child of the wrap that does not contain the stage. The rule is
 * deliberately written structurally rather than as a list of selectors, so
 * exactly this case works without anyone maintaining it.
