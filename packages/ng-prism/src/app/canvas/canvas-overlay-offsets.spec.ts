/**
 * Canvas overlays agree on where the stage's usable area begins.
 *
 * `.prism-canvas-stage` publishes `--prism-canvas-overlay-top` and
 * `--prism-canvas-overlay-inline`, and grows both when `[data-rulers]` puts a
 * 20px ruler band along its top and left edges. Anything floating over the
 * canvas reads those instead of hard-coding a corner.
 *
 * `prism-canvas-bg-pill` inherits them, being inside the stage. The tool rail
 * cannot: capture mode's structural rule only suppresses a direct child of
 * `.prism-canvas-wrap` that does not contain the stage, so the rail has to live
 * outside it. It therefore mirrors the same two values off `canvas.rulers()`,
 * and mirrored values drift — this test is what stops them.
 *
 * The failure it guards is not subtle to a user and invisible to a test suite:
 * with the rail at the no-rulers offset, switching rulers on slides the ruler
 * band underneath the buttons.
