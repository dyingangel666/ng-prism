 * and `.prism-main`'s background paints there instead. The canvas is `flex: 1`
 * and only gets the space back once its siblings leave layout.
 *
 * Structural rather than a list of chrome selectors: at each level from the
 * shell to the canvas wrap, the child leading to the stage survives and every
 * sibling goes, so a new shell region is covered without touching this file.

 * the survivor lands in the first sized track and the canvas renders 52px tall

/**
 * Global stylesheet applied in capture mode.
 *
 * Document-level because emulated encapsulation would stop a renderer rule from
 * reaching the dynamically created showcase component's transitions and
 * animations.
 *
 * `background-image` is stripped because the dot/checker pattern's phase shifts
 * whenever the centred component resizes; the declared colour is deterministic
 * and stays. `!important` is required to beat the component-scoped stage rules.
 * `transparent` also drops the colour, across the layers in
 * {@link CAPTURE_TRANSPARENT_SELECTOR}; alpha is per-pixel and does not shift.
 * The rules from {@link CAPTURE_CANVAS_ONLY_SELECTOR} down give the canvas the
 * whole viewport, so the background covers the capture target's whole box.
 *
 * The stage padding goes too. The stage is `height: 100%` under `content-box`,
 * so the padding makes it 64px taller than its row and centres the component
 * 32px too low. Without it the stage is the canvas, and a component is
 * contained iff it fits the viewport.
 *
 * The stage edge is `outline` plus `box-shadow`, never a border, so it does not
 * move `.demo-wrap`'s centre and shift baselines. It still paints, and with the
 * padding gone it sits flush against the component, so capture mode removes the
 * paint and keeps the geometry. {@link CAPTURE_TRANSPARENT_SELECTOR} does not
 * cover this: an outline is not a background.

/**

 * same on every run and a runner can screenshot `.demo-wrap` directly. It
 * cannot make room the viewport lacks: sizing the viewport is the runner's job.
 *
 * The flag is read once from the URL in the constructor and never written back.
 * {@link PrismUrlStateService} rebuilds the query string, so `?capture=1` leaves
 * the address bar on navigation while the mode stays on. Reading it during
 * `PrismUrlStateService.init()` instead would make zoom-locking racy:
 * `PrismCanvasService` restores persisted zoom in its own constructor, which
