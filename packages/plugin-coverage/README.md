# @ng-prism/plugin-coverage

Test coverage plugin for [@ng-prism/core](https://github.com/dyingangel666/ng-prism). Reads Istanbul/v8 coverage reports at build time and displays per-component test coverage metrics with a score circle in the tab bar.

> **Full documentation:** [ng-prism Docs — Coverage Plugin](https://dyingangel666.github.io/ng-prism/#/plugins/coverage)

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ng-prism/plugin-coverage
```

### Peer Dependencies

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| `@ng-prism/core` | `>=21.0.0` |
| `@angular/core` | `>=20.0.0` |

## Setup

```typescript
// ng-prism.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@ng-prism/core/config';
import { coveragePlugin } from '@ng-prism/plugin-coverage';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    coveragePlugin({
      coveragePath: 'coverage/coverage-summary.json',
    }),
  ],
});
```

## What It Does

- Adds a **Coverage** panel to the addon tab bar
- Shows a **score circle** with the average coverage percentage (like the A11y panel)
- Displays 4 metric bars: Statements, Branches, Functions, Lines
- Color-coded thresholds: green (>= 80%), yellow (>= 50%), red (< 50%)
- Works with any test runner that outputs Istanbul-compatible coverage (Jest, Karma, Vitest, nyc, c8)

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `coveragePath` | `'coverage/coverage-summary.json'` | Path to the Istanbul coverage summary file (relative to workspace root) |

## Example

Generate coverage with your test runner, then start the showcase:

```bash
npx nx test my-lib --coverage
ng run my-lib:prism
```

Each component's Coverage tab shows its statement, branch, function, and line coverage with a score circle in the tab bar.

## How It Works

**Build time:** The `onComponentScanned` hook reads `coverage-summary.json` (cached per build run, with mtime-based invalidation) and matches entries to components by file path. Coverage data is injected into `showcaseConfig.meta.coverage`.

**Runtime:** The `CoveragePanelComponent` reads the metadata and renders the metric bars. The score circle is rendered in `PrismPanelHostComponent` using the same `A11yScoreComponent`. The panel component is lazy-loaded via `loadComponent`.
