# State Preservation

ng-prism keeps the UI state alive across full-page reloads — the workflow you care about during component-driven development. Two layers cooperate:

- **URL** carries shareable state (component, variant, view, panel tab) — bookmarkable, deep-linkable.
- **sessionStorage** carries per-session ephemeral state (control panel input overrides, a11y sub-tab, perspective) — quiet on the URL.

After editing a SCSS file in your library and waiting for the dev-server reload, you land back on the same component, same variant, with the same control overrides applied. No more clicking your way back to where you were.

## URL Parameters

| Parameter | Example | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `component` | `?component=ButtonComponent` | Active component class name |
| `page` | `?page=Button%20Patterns` | Active page title (URL-encoded) |
| `variant` | `?variant=1` | Active variant index (0-based) |
| `view` | `?view=docs` | Active view tab (e.g. `docs`, `a11y`) |
| `panel` | `?panel=a11y` | Active addon panel tab (default: `controls`, omitted when default) |

Example URL:

```
http://localhost:4200?component=ButtonComponent&variant=2&view=docs&panel=a11y
```

## Deep-Linking

Share a URL pointing directly to a specific component and variant. Anyone opening the link lands on exactly the same state.

```
http://localhost:4200?component=AlertComponent&variant=1
```

## Browser Back/Forward

Each navigation (selecting a component, changing variant, switching view) pushes a new browser history entry. The browser back and forward buttons move through the navigation history as expected.

## Control Panel & A11y State (sessionStorage)

URL state does not carry control panel overrides — long input strings would bloat every link. Instead, ng-prism mirrors these to `sessionStorage` under the key `ng-prism:state`:

- Control input overrides, keyed by `className` + `variantIndex`. Each component keeps its own bucket; switching components does not discard the others.
- A11y panel `activeTab` (`violations` | `keyboard` | `tree` | `sr`) and `perspective` (`visual` | `screen-reader`).

Writes are debounced 200ms, so rapid keystrokes in a text input do not thrash storage. On reload, the persisted bucket is applied only if the persisted `variantIndex` still matches the active variant restored from the URL — preventing stale overrides from leaking into a different variant.

> Layout, theme, and canvas (zoom/background) are persisted independently to `localStorage` by their own services (`ng-prism-layout`, `ng-prism-theme`, `ng-prism-canvas`) and survive across browser sessions.

## Opting Out

Disable each layer independently:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  urlState: false,      // disables URL sync
  persistState: false,  // disables sessionStorage for controls + a11y
});
```

When `urlState` is `false`, the URL never changes and no state is read from it on load. When `persistState` is `false`, control overrides and the a11y sub-tab reset on every reload.

## How It Works

`PrismUrlStateService` reads the URL on startup via `window.location.search` and sets the initial navigation state. It then subscribes to navigation signal changes and calls `history.pushState()` (or `replaceState()` when only sub-state changes) to keep the URL in sync.

`PrismPersistenceService` reads `sessionStorage` after the URL service has selected the active component, then applies persisted control values that match the current `className` + `variantIndex`. It subscribes to the same signals and debounce-writes back on change. Schema-version, corrupted JSON, quota-exceeded, and missing-`sessionStorage` are all handled gracefully without crashing the app.

Both services are initialized automatically by `PrismShellComponent` in this order: `urlStateService.init()` → `persistenceService.init()`. If you use a custom shell component (`appComponent`), call them manually during bootstrap:

```typescript
@Component({ ... })
export class MyShellComponent {
  constructor() {
    inject(PrismUrlStateService).init();
    inject(PrismPersistenceService).init();
  }
}
```
