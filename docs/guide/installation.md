# Installation & Setup

## Prerequisites

- Angular 20+ workspace (tested against 20, 21, 22)
- Node.js 20+, npm 10+
- Angular CLI and Nx workspaces are both supported — see [Nx Workspaces](#nx-workspaces)

## Automatic Setup — `ng add`

The fastest path is the `ng add` schematic. It creates a showcase app project, wires up the Angular builder targets, and generates a config file in one command.

```bash
ng add @ng-prism/core
```

The schematic prompts for:

| Prompt            | Default             | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Library project   | _(first lib found)_ | The library whose components you want to showcase |
| Showcase app name | `{lib}-prism`       | Name of the generated Angular app project         |

After running, your workspace contains:

```
projects/
  my-lib-prism/          ← generated showcase app
    src/
      main.ts            ← bootstraps the Prism app
      index.html
    tsconfig.app.json
ng-prism.config.ts       ← your configuration file (workspace root)
angular.json             ← prism / prism-build targets added to my-lib
tsconfig.json            ← path mappings added here
```

The showcase app is placed next to the library it documents, so a library in `libs/` yields a showcase app in `libs/` too. See [Nx Workspaces](#nx-workspaces) for how that plays out there.

The schematic also adds a `strip-showcase` npm script to your `package.json`. This strips `@Showcase` decorators from compiled library output before publishing. See [Publishing Libraries](guide/library-publishing.md) for details.

## Verify

```bash
ng run my-lib:prism        # or whatever the schematic named it
```

The showcase opens at `http://localhost:4400`.

## Nx Workspaces

ng-prism works in Nx workspaces that define projects through per-project `project.json` files. Run the schematic through Nx rather than the Angular CLI:

```bash
npx nx g @ng-prism/core:ng-add --project=my-lib
```

`ng add @ng-prism/core` does **not** work here — the Angular CLI refuses to run outside a workspace it recognises, and an Nx workspace has no root `angular.json`. Nx's generator bridge supplies the workspace configuration to the schematic and writes the result back into the relevant `project.json` files, converting `architect` to `targets` and `builder` to `executor` along the way.

The schematic adapts to the workspace it finds:

| Aspect              | Angular CLI                           | Nx                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Showcase app root   | next to the library, e.g. `projects/` | `apps/` when present, otherwise next to the library |
| Application builder | `@angular-devkit/build-angular`       | `@angular/build` when it is a direct dependency     |
| Path mappings       | `tsconfig.json`                       | `tsconfig.base.json`                                |
| Targets             | `architect` / `builder`               | `targets` / `executor`                              |

The app root also honours `workspaceLayout.appsDir` in `nx.json` when you have configured one. Existing path mappings are never overwritten, so the `my-lib` → `src/index.ts` mapping Nx generated for your library stays as it is.

Run the targets the usual way:

```bash
npx nx run my-lib:prism          # dev server on :4400
npx nx run my-lib:prism-build    # production build
```

> If Nx reports `Cannot find target 'prism'` straight after running the schematic, its project graph is stale — `npx nx reset` clears it.

## Zoneless Mode (optional, recommended)

ng-prism supports Angular's zoneless change detection. Pass `--zoneless` during setup to skip the `zone.js` polyfill:

```bash
ng add @ng-prism/core --zoneless
```

This removes ~30 KB from the bundle and aligns with the modern Angular direction. ng-prism itself is fully signal-based, and the scanner already requires `input()`/`output()` signals on every showcased component — so zoneless is safe by design.

### Migrating an existing setup to zoneless

Three manual edits are needed:

**1. `projects/<lib>-prism/src/main.ts`** — add `provideZonelessChangeDetection()`:

```diff
+import { provideZonelessChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';
 import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
 import { PrismShellComponent, providePrism } from '@ng-prism/core';
 import { PRISM_RUNTIME_MANIFEST } from 'prism-manifest/<lib>-prism';
 import config from 'ng-prism.config';

 bootstrapApplication(PrismShellComponent, {
-  providers: [providePrism(PRISM_RUNTIME_MANIFEST, config)],
+  providers: [
+    provideZonelessChangeDetection(),
+    providePrism(PRISM_RUNTIME_MANIFEST, config),
+  ],
 });
```

Order matters: `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` must come before `providePrism()`.

**2. `angular.json`** — remove the `zone.js` polyfill from the Prism app's build target:

```diff
 "projects": {
   "<lib>-prism": {
     "architect": {
       "build": {
         "options": {
-          "polyfills": ["zone.js"],
+          "polyfills": [],
```

**3. `ng-prism.config.ts`** — if your `appProviders` contains zone-dependent providers (e.g. older animation modules, `provideZoneChangeDetection`), remove them or swap for zoneless-compatible alternatives.

**Verify:** Run `ng run <lib>:prism` — the app should boot without errors and all showcases should render. Bundle size drops by ~30 KB (zone.js is no longer loaded).

## Angular Builder Targets

The schematic adds two targets to the **library project** in `angular.json`:

```json
"prism": {
  "builder": "@ng-prism/core:serve",
  "options": {
    "entryPoint": "projects/my-lib",
    "prismProject": "my-lib-prism",
    "libraryProject": "my-lib",
    "port": 4400
  }
},
"prism-build": {
  "builder": "@ng-prism/core:build",
  "options": {
    "entryPoint": "projects/my-lib",
    "prismProject": "my-lib-prism",
    "libraryProject": "my-lib",
    "outputPath": "dist/my-lib-prism"
  }
}
```

- **`@ng-prism/core:serve`** — runs the TypeScript scanner, generates a runtime manifest, then delegates to the Angular dev server. Watches for file changes and re-scans incrementally.
- **`@ng-prism/core:build`** — same pipeline but runs the Angular production build and exits.

### Builder Options

| Option              | Required      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entryPoint`        | Yes           | Path to the library directory (recommended) or to its barrel `public-api.ts` file. When pointed at a file, the pipeline walks upward to find the nearest `ng-package.json` and treats that directory as the library root, so secondary entry points are still discovered automatically. |
| `prismProject`      | Yes           | Angular project name for the generated showcase app                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `libraryProject`    | No            | Angular project name of the library being showcased — only used as a fallback for `libraryImportPath`                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `libraryImportPath` | No            | Override the import path used in the generated manifest (defaults to `libraryProject`)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `configFile`        | No            | Path to your config file (default: `ng-prism.config.ts` at workspace root)                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `port`              | No            | Dev server port for `:serve` (default: `4400`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `outputPath`        | `:build` only | Output directory for the production build                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `cacheDir`          | No            | Override directory for the generated `prism-manifest.ts`. Default: `<workspaceRoot>/ng-prism-cache/<prismProject>/`. Relative paths resolve against `workspaceRoot`. Useful for CI sandboxes.                                                                                           |

## Showcase App Target Configuration

The schematic also adds a separate **showcase app project** (`my-lib-prism`) to `angular.json` with its own build and serve targets:

```json
"my-lib-prism": {
  "architect": {
    "build": {
      "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application",
      "options": {
        "outputPath": { "base": "dist/my-lib-prism", "browser": "" },
        "index": "projects/my-lib-prism/src/index.html",
        "browser": "projects/my-lib-prism/src/main.ts",
        "tsConfig": "projects/my-lib-prism/tsconfig.app.json",
        "styles": ["node_modules/highlight.js/styles/base16/solarized-dark.min.css"],
        "polyfills": ["zone.js"],
        "allowedCommonJsDependencies": ["highlight.js"],
        "preserveSymlinks": true
      },
      "configurations": {
        "production": {
          "outputHashing": "all"
        },
        "development": {
          "outputHashing": "none",
          "optimization": false,
          "sourceMap": true
        }
      },
      "defaultConfiguration": "production"
    },
    "serve": {
      "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
      "options": {
        "buildTarget": "my-lib-prism:build:development",
        "port": 4400,
        "hmr": true,
        "liveReload": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> The builder package is picked to match your workspace: `@angular/build` when it is a direct dependency (typical for Nx and newer Angular workspaces), otherwise `@angular-devkit/build-angular`. Both expose the same `:application` and `:dev-server` builders.

The configuration split is intentional:

- `outputHashing` lives only in the `production` configuration. Hashed filenames (`main.abc123.js`) are needed for production cache-busting but are incompatible with HMR — the dev server prints `Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is disabled because the 'outputHashing' option is set to 'all'.` in the terminal when hashing is on.
- The `development` configuration disables hashing, turns off optimization, and enables source maps — the usual Angular dev defaults.
- The `serve` target explicitly points at `:build:development` so iteration uses the dev configuration.
- The `polyfills` array shown above is the zone-based default. When set up with `--zoneless`, this field is `[]` instead — see [Zoneless Mode](#zoneless-mode-optional-recommended) above.

## Dev Reload Behavior

Angular's `@angular/build:application` builds the entire app into a single bundle (`main.js`). True module-level HMR — where individual modules get hot-swapped — is not possible against a monolithic bundle. In practice that means **edits trigger a full page refresh**, even with `hmr: true`. ng-prism turns this from a workflow blocker into an acceptable iteration loop through two layers:

1. **The dev configuration skips minification and source-map optimization.** Library and showcase rebuilds typically complete in 300-900ms.
2. **State preservation across reloads** (built into ng-prism): the active component, variant, view tab, addon panel tab, control panel overrides, and a11y sub-state are restored after the page reloads, so iterating on a specific variant doesn't lose context. See [State Preservation](guide/url-state.md).

`liveReload: true` is the recommended default — it triggers the reload automatically. Setting `liveReload: false` is only useful if you want to refresh manually (for example to inspect server-side state between edits).

### What ng-prism's watcher does

The `@ng-prism/core:serve` builder runs its own incremental scanner on the library entry point. The scanner only reacts to **`.ts` file changes** — style and template edits don't need a manifest rescan and are handled directly by Angular's dev server. Concretely:

| Edit                                       | ng-prism scanner                                  | Angular dev server |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `.ts` (component logic, `@Showcase`, etc.) | re-scan + regenerate manifest if metadata changed | rebuild + reload   |
| `.scss` / `.css` / `.svg`                  | skipped                                           | rebuild + reload   |
| `.html` template                           | skipped                                           | rebuild + reload   |
| `ng-prism.config.ts`                       | re-scan + regenerate manifest                     | rebuild + reload   |

Skipping the scan for style and template changes shaves ~300-500ms off every save, since the TypeScript compiler API doesn't need to traverse the library source tree for those edits.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use the schematic, follow these steps:

**1. Install the package**

```bash
npm install @ng-prism/core
```

**2. Create a showcase app project** in your workspace (a standard Angular app is fine).

**3. Create `prism.config.ts`** in the showcase app:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@ng-prism/core';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [],
});
```

**4. Update `main.ts`** to use `providePrism`:

```typescript
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { PrismShellComponent, providePrism } from '@ng-prism/core';
import { PRISM_RUNTIME_MANIFEST } from 'prism-manifest/my-lib-prism'; // generated by the builder into ng-prism-cache/my-lib-prism/
import config from './prism.config.js';

bootstrapApplication(PrismShellComponent, {
  providers: [providePrism(PRISM_RUNTIME_MANIFEST, config)],
});
```

The import specifier `prism-manifest/<prism-project>` is resolved via a wildcard path mapping in `tsconfig.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "prism-manifest/*": ["./ng-prism-cache/*/prism-manifest.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

The schematic adds both the path mapping and a workspace-wide `ng-prism-cache/` entry in `.gitignore` automatically.

**5. Add builder targets** to `angular.json` as shown in the [Builder Targets](#angular-builder-targets) section above. In an Nx workspace they go into the library's `project.json` under `targets`, with `executor` instead of `builder` — see [Nx Workspaces](#nx-workspaces).

## Adding Plugins

All official plugins ship with their own `ng-add` schematic. Adding a plugin is a single command:

```bash
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-jsdoc
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-box-model
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-coverage
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-figma
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-perf
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-visual-regression
```

Each command installs the plugin into `devDependencies` and registers it in `ng-prism.config.ts`. Re-running is safe — already-registered plugins are skipped.

See [Plugin Overview](plugins/overview.md) for details on what each plugin provides.

## Peer Dependencies

Nothing has to be installed by hand:

| Package                           | Provided by                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `axe-core`                        | ships as a dependency of `@ng-prism/core` |
| `highlight.js`, `ngx-highlightjs` | installed by `ng add @ng-prism/core`      |

`axe-core` powers the built-in [accessibility panel](guide/accessibility.md) and is loaded lazily, so it costs nothing until you open that panel.
