# External Tooling API

A built Prism app is a static site. That makes it a convenient target for tools that drive it from the outside: accessibility audits, visual regression runners, link checkers, screenshot generators for a design system site.

ng-prism exposes a small, stable contract for those tools. This page is the canonical reference for it; the [Accessibility](guide/accessibility.md) and [Visual Regression](guide/visual-regression.md) guides build on it.

> These anchors are public API. They are covered by the same semver policy as the TypeScript surface, so renaming `.demo-wrap` or `data-prism-rendered` is a breaking change.

## The Anchors

| Anchor                                                               | Where                           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `window.__PRISM_MANIFEST__`                                          | global, set by `providePrism()` | Shape: `{ components: [{ className, title, meta?, variants: [{ name, index, bg, meta? }] }], pages: [{ title }] }`. Use it to enumerate what to visit.             |
| URL params `?component=<className>&variant=<index>`                  | navigation state                | Drive the app to a specific component+variant from the outside. `variant` is the array index; omit it for index `0`.                                               |
| `[data-prism-rendered="<className>:<variantIndex>"]` on `.demo-wrap` | renderer host element           | Render marker. Wait for this attribute to match the expected key before inspecting the variant.                                                                    |
| `?capture=1`                                                         | URL param                       | [Capture isolation mode](#capture-isolation-mode): strips canvas chrome, hands the canvas the whole viewport and freezes the render for deterministic screenshots. |

### Enumerating what exists

`__PRISM_MANIFEST__` is a thin discovery view of the runtime manifest and carries no Angular class references.

```js
await page.goto(baseUrl, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
await page.waitForFunction(() => globalThis.__PRISM_MANIFEST__ !== undefined);
const manifest = await page.evaluate(() => globalThis.__PRISM_MANIFEST__);

// manifest.components -> [{ className: 'ButtonComponent', title: 'Button',
//                          variants: [{ name: 'Primary', index: 0, bg: 'light' }, ...] }]
// manifest.pages      -> [{ title: 'Button Patterns' }]
```

`title` is the `@Showcase` display name; `className` is the class. A component with no declared variants still reports one entry: `[{ name: 'Default', index: 0, bg: ... }]`.

The type is exported as `DiscoveryManifest` from `@ng-prism/core/plugin`.

### Reading the background

Every variant reports the canvas background it renders on. A component may declare one for all its variants, and a variant may declare its own:

```ts
@Showcase({
  title: 'Button',
  bg: 'light', // applies to every variant below
  variants: [
    { name: 'Filled' },
    { name: 'On dark', bg: 'dark' }, // wins for this variant
  ],
})
```

`bg` is already resolved and always present, so a tool reads one field instead of reimplementing the fallback:

```js
// variants -> [{ name: 'Filled', index: 0, bg: 'light' },
//              { name: 'On dark', index: 1, bg: 'dark' }]
```

The resolution order is variant, then component, then `transparent` (exported as `DEFAULT_VARIANT_BG` from `@ng-prism/core/plugin`, alongside the `CanvasBg` type and `resolveVariantBg()`). `transparent` means "nothing declared" and is captured without a backdrop. It was `checker` in `22.2.0-beta.0` and `-beta.1`; see [the note on the change](guide/visual-regression.md#breaking-the-default-background-changed).

> [Capture mode](#capture-isolation-mode) paints this background, so the manifest value and the screenshot always agree.

The default has no colour, so it cannot pick one up from the active theme. A runner that screenshots an undeclared variant must pass `omitBackground: true`, or the browser's own page backdrop ends up in the image; see [Capturing transparency](guide/visual-regression.md#capturing-transparency).

When a variant needs a specific surface, declare it. `light` and `dark` are absolute colours (`--prism-void-light`, `--prism-void-dark`) and flat, so use one when the component was built for that surface. `dots`, `plain` and `checker` all land on the themed surface, so a capture on one of them is only as stable as the theme.

### Reading `@Showcase` metadata

`meta` from the decorator is exposed on both levels, so a tool can decide how to treat a component or a single variant without a separate config file on its side. It is omitted when the decorator declares none.

```ts
@Showcase({
  title: 'Tooltip',
  variants: [
    // A tooltip only renders after hover, so a screenshot would capture the trigger.
    { name: 'Top Position', meta: { vrt: { skip: true } } },
    { name: 'Disabled' },
  ],
})
```

```js
const skip = (component, variant) => variant.meta?.['vrt']?.skip ?? component.meta?.['vrt']?.skip ?? false;
```

Build-time plugin hooks write into the same `meta`, so plugin output (for example the Coverage plugin's per-component numbers) is visible here too.

> Only JSON-safe values cross over. The global is read through a structured-clone bridge, and `meta` is an open `Record<string, unknown>`. Primitives, arrays and plain objects are passed through; class instances (Angular types included), functions, symbols, non-finite numbers, `Date`, `Map` and DOM nodes are dropped rather than half-serialised, and cycles are broken. Unrepresentable array entries become `null` so indices stay stable. Keep anything a tool must read to plain data.

### Navigating

Set `component` (and optionally `variant`) on the URL and reload. `variant` is a 0-based index into the `variants` array; values outside the array are ignored and the app falls back to index `0`.

```js
const url = new URL(baseUrl);
url.searchParams.set('component', 'ButtonComponent');
url.searchParams.set('variant', '2');
await page.goto(url.toString(), { waitUntil: 'load' });
```

> On a bare URL with no `component` or `page` parameter, nothing is selected and `.demo-wrap` does not exist. Always navigate to a component before waiting for the render marker.

### Waiting for a render

`data-prism-rendered` appears on `.demo-wrap` once the component instance has been created:

```js
await page.waitForFunction(([expected]) => document.querySelector('.demo-wrap')?.getAttribute('data-prism-rendered')?.startsWith(expected), [`${comp.className}:`]);
```

> The marker means the component was instantiated; it may not be visually settled yet. Fonts may still be swapping and transitions may still be running when it appears. For anything pixel-sensitive, see [Visual Regression](guide/visual-regression.md).

## Capture Isolation Mode

Element-scoped screenshots composite whatever is painted behind and inside the target element. For `.demo-wrap` that means the canvas dot grid, rulers, the zoom badge, the centre crosshair and any active panel overlay all end up in the image. And because the component is centred, the grid phase beneath it shifts whenever the component changes size, so an unrelated size change makes every pixel under the component differ.

The background colour does not cause that problem, and a variant that declares `bg: 'dark'` needs that surface in its baseline. Capture mode therefore removes the pattern and keeps the colour.

An alpha channel, unlike a pattern, has no phase that moves when the component resizes, so `bg: 'transparent'` can be captured see-through and still be deterministic. See [Capturing transparency](guide/visual-regression.md#capturing-transparency).

Add `capture=1` to the URL to render in an isolated mode built for screenshotting:

```
http://localhost:4200/?component=ButtonComponent&variant=2&capture=1
```

Accepted as "on": `?capture`, `?capture=1`, `?capture=true`. Anything else, including `?capture=0` and `?capture=false`, is off.

When active, ng-prism:

| Effect                            | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strips canvas patterns**        | Removes the dot grid and the checkerboard, plus rulers, crosshair, zoom badge and background pill. The background _colour_ stays opaque, except for `bg: 'transparent'`, whose colour is cleared along with the colour of every wrapper behind the canvas, so the capture carries a real alpha channel. That one needs `omitBackground: true` on the runner's side; see [Capturing transparency](guide/visual-regression.md#capturing-transparency). |
| **Keeps declared backgrounds**    | `@Showcase({ bg })` and a per-variant `bg` survive, so a variant is captured on the surface it was designed for; with neither declared it lands on `DEFAULT_VARIANT_BG` rather than on the session's canvas background. Either way the surface is the `bg` [reported for the variant](#reading-the-background). A manual user override does not survive, because it is session UI state and not part of the variant.                                 |
| **Gives the canvas the viewport** | Every shell region that is not the canvas (header, sidebar, view tabs, component head, variant ribbon, the addon panel and its resizer, the floating canvas rail) is removed from layout, and the stage loses its padding, so the canvas fills the window. This makes the declared background cover all of `.demo-wrap`'s box; see [the guarantee](#the-guarantee-and-its-one-limit).                                                                |
| **Locks zoom to 1**               | Persisted canvas state in `localStorage` (zoom, guides, rulers, background) is neither read nor written.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Suppresses overlays**           | Panel overlays render _inside_ `.demo-wrap`; in capture mode they are not rendered and lazy overlay components are never even fetched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Freezes motion**                | Transitions and animations are disabled document-wide, including inside your own component, via a document-level stylesheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Skips state restore**           | `sessionStorage` state (control-panel input overrides, a11y sub-tab) is not restored, so a previous session cannot alter what you capture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The mode is a single switch with nothing else to configure, so a CI job can use it on a prebuilt styleguide it cannot reconfigure.

### Detecting it

While active, the document element carries a marker attribute:

```js
await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.hasAttribute('data-prism-capture'));
```

You can hook your own rules onto it, for example to neutralise something specific to your library:

```css
[data-prism-capture] .my-lib-live-clock {
    visibility: hidden;
}
```

### It is read once, and never written back

The flag is parsed from the URL a single time when the app boots. ng-prism rebuilds the query string from scratch whenever navigation state changes, so `capture=1` disappears from the address bar on the first in-app navigation while the mode itself stays on for the lifetime of the document.

Consequences for tooling:

- Navigating with a full page load per variant (the normal pattern) works as expected. Pass `capture=1` on every URL.
- Driving navigation in-page (clicking the sidebar, pushing history) keeps capture mode on, but the URL no longer advertises it. Do not read the mode back off `window.location`; use the `data-prism-capture` attribute instead.
- **Reloading after in-page navigation drops the mode.** `page.reload()`, or navigating to a URL derived from `page.url()`, replays an address the flag has already been stripped from, so the document boots without it and renders with the full shell. Nothing errors and the screenshot still looks plausible, so the recorded baseline is contaminated. Keep `capture=1` in the URL your runner holds instead of reading the one the app shows.

### The guarantee, and its one limit

Capture mode guarantees that `.demo-wrap` is composited against its declared background over its whole box, including the part that would scroll out of the canvas while browsing. That is why a runner can screenshot `.demo-wrap` directly instead of reconstructing the component's bounds.

Until 22.2.0-beta.4 the shell was left in place, on the assumption that it "sits outside `.demo-wrap` and never appears in an element-scoped screenshot". The same mistake is easy to make in your own CSS. The component is centred in a canvas that scrolls, and a screenshot tool captures the screen coordinates of the target's whole box, so wherever the box extends past the canvas, the image picks up whatever paints there. Measured in Chromium at a 1280x720 viewport, a 200x400 component leaked 57px upwards into the variant ribbon and 121px downwards into the addon panel. This is not a z-order or clipping problem: the target does extend beyond its scroll container.

The limit: capture mode cannot make room the window does not have. The canvas is the viewport, so a component larger than the viewport still overflows it, and the overflowing part is composited against whatever lies outside the canvas. Size the runner's viewport to the largest variant you baseline.

### What it does not change

Your component is instantiated with the same inputs, in the same injector, at the same zoom, in the same document. The shell regions capture mode drops are removed from layout but stay mounted, and nothing about the component's own box depends on them. A view with no canvas at all (a [component page](guide/component-pages.md), a plugin view panel) renders as usual; the guarantee is about the canvas, and blanking the shell around a page would only produce an empty screenshot.

To strip the shell for embedding instead of screenshots, see [Custom UI Sections](guide/custom-ui.md).
