# Plugin Hooks

Plugin hooks are the build-time extension points of ng-prism. They run inside the Angular builder (Node.js) as part of the pipeline between scanning and manifest writing.

## Hook Execution Order

For each pipeline run, hooks execute in this sequence:

```
For each component (in scan order):
  → plugin[0].onComponentScanned(component)
  → plugin[1].onComponentScanned(component)
  → ...

For each page (in config order):
  → plugin[0].onPageScanned(page)
  → plugin[1].onPageScanned(page)
  → ...

Once, with the full manifest:
  → plugin[0].onManifestReady(manifest)
  → plugin[1].onManifestReady(manifest)
  → ...
```

Plugins run in registration order within each phase. The output of one plugin is the input to the next — hooks chain.

## `onComponentScanned`

Called once per `@Showcase`-decorated component after all metadata has been extracted by the scanner.

```typescript
onComponentScanned(component: ScannedComponent): ScannedComponent | void | Promise<ScannedComponent | void>
```

**Mutation pattern** — mutate the object in place and return `void`, or return a new object. Returning `void` (or `undefined`) keeps the previous value.

```typescript
onComponentScanned(component) {
  component.meta = {
    ...component.meta,
    myPlugin: { extractedAt: Date.now() },
  };
  // no return → keeps mutated object
}
```

**Return new object:**

```typescript
onComponentScanned(component) {
  return {
    ...component,
    meta: { ...component.meta, extra: 'value' },
  };
}
```

**Chaining:** When plugin A and plugin B both implement `onComponentScanned`, the `ScannedComponent` passed to plugin B is the (possibly modified) output from plugin A.

**Typical uses:**

- Extract JSDoc from `component.filePath` using `ts.createSourceFile()` (JSDoc plugin)
- Fetch external metadata keyed on `component.className`
- Validate that required `meta` fields are present and warn if missing

## `onPageScanned`

Called once per `StyleguidePage` after all pages are collected (both `config.pages` entries and Component Pages).

```typescript
onPageScanned(page: StyleguidePage): StyleguidePage | void | Promise<StyleguidePage | void>
```

Same mutation/return pattern as `onComponentScanned`.

```typescript
onPageScanned(page) {
  if (page.type === 'custom' && page.data['markdown']) {
    page.data = {
      ...page.data,
      html: renderMarkdown(page.data['markdown'] as string),
    };
  }
}
```

## `onManifestReady`

Called once with the complete `PrismManifest` after all `onComponentScanned` and `onPageScanned` hooks have finished.

```typescript
onManifestReady(manifest: PrismManifest): PrismManifest | void | Promise<PrismManifest | void>
```

Use for cross-component transformations or manifest-level filtering.

```typescript
onManifestReady(manifest) {
  // Filter out components tagged 'internal'
  manifest.components = manifest.components.filter(
    (c) => !c.showcaseConfig.tags?.includes('internal'),
  );
}
```

Return a new manifest object for immutable transforms:

```typescript
onManifestReady(manifest) {
  return {
    ...manifest,
    components: manifest.components.map(addGlobalMeta),
  };
}
```

Use `manifest.meta` for library-wide values that runtime components (e.g. header widgets) should read:

```typescript
onManifestReady(manifest) {
  return {
    ...manifest,
    meta: {
      ...manifest.meta,
      coverage: { total: readTotalCoverage(path), thresholds },
    },
  };
}
```

`manifest.meta` is serialized into the runtime manifest and accessible via the `PRISM_MANIFEST` injection token in the browser.

## Navigation Decorations

`NgPrismPlugin.navigationDecorations` lets a plugin mark a component's sidebar item with a small icon — the built-in a11y, visual regression and coverage sources all use it to flag a component whose latest report needs attention. It is a runtime contribution (its `badge()` callback runs in the browser), but the verdict it displays has to be decided here, at build time. This section explains why.

### The two-zone principle

Every component's navigation item has two places a marker can live:

- **The leading icon** carries _lifecycle_ — what the author declared with `@Showcase({ status })`. It speaks in **form alone**: `box` for a normal component, `box-select` for `'wip'`, a struck-through name for `'deprecated'`. Never colour.
- **The trailing slot** carries _health_ — what a report measured. It speaks in **colour alone**: `warn` (amber) or `danger` (red), via `NavigationDecoration.variant`.

The split is deliberate, not cosmetic. Before `navigationDecorations` existed, the work-in-progress marker was a 6px amber dot in the trailing slot — the exact position and the exact colour a health signal wants. Had a coverage or a11y marker landed there too, the two would have been indistinguishable: a reader could not tell "the author isn't done with this yet" from "the last audit found a problem". Keeping lifecycle in the leading slot, expressed only as shape, and health in the trailing slot, expressed only as colour, means colour in the sidebar now means exactly one thing — measured quality — and nothing else competes for it.

### Why the threshold decision has to happen in a hook

A `NavigationDecorationDefinition.badge()` callback receives one `RuntimeComponent` and nothing else — no injected services, no access to the plugin's configured thresholds, no view of any other component in the library. That is enough to _read_ a verdict, but not enough to _decide_ one: it cannot tell whether 72% coverage is fine or a regression, because "fine" is a library-wide threshold the badge callback never sees.

That decision is made once, in `onComponentScanned`, which does have everything it needs — the plugin's resolved thresholds (closed over from `options`), and the one component's raw numbers — and is only ever run at build time, in Node.js, never on every change-detection tick. The hook writes its verdict into `component.showcaseConfig.meta` as an already-decided `{ variant, label }` pair, conventionally under a `summary` field. `badge()` then does no more than read that field back:

```typescript
// packages/plugin-coverage/src/coverage-contributions.ts (shipped)
badge: (component) => {
  const meta = componentMeta(component);
  if (!meta?.found || !meta.summary) return null;
  if (meta.summary.variant === 'ok') return null;
  return { variant: meta.summary.variant, label: meta.summary.label };
},
```

Note that `meta.summary.variant` above is three-valued (`'ok' | 'warn' | 'danger'`) — it is the plugin's own build-time verdict type (`CoverageSummary`, `VrtStat`, …), and it has to include `'ok'` because the hook that writes it needs a way to say "healthy". The public `NavigationDecoration` returned by `badge()` is deliberately two-valued (`'warn' | 'danger'`, no `'ok'`) — the `if (... === 'ok') return null;` line above is exactly where the narrowing happens, not a special case.

All three built-in sources follow this split — see `packages/plugin-visual-regression/src/panel-contributions.ts` and `packages/plugin-coverage/src/coverage-contributions.ts` for the shipped `onComponentScanned` → `summary` → `badge()` chain, and [`NavigationDecorationDefinition`](api/ng-prism-plugin.md#navigationdecorationdefinition) for the full field reference and the reserved `order` values.

## Async Hooks

All three hooks accept `Promise` return values. The pipeline runner uses `await` for each hook:

```typescript
async onComponentScanned(component) {
  const result = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/meta/${component.className}`);
  const data = await result.json();
  component.meta = { ...component.meta, remote: data };
}
```

The pipeline is sequential — it does not parallelize hook calls within a phase. If a hook is slow, it blocks the full rebuild. Keep async hooks lightweight.

## Error Handling

If a hook throws, the error propagates out of `runPluginHooks()` and is caught by the builder, which logs it and marks the build as failed. The Angular dev server is not started if the pipeline fails.

## What Cannot Be Done in Hooks

Build-time hooks run in Node.js. The following are not available:

- Browser globals (`window`, `document`, `navigator`)
- Angular APIs that require the browser (`@angular/platform-browser`, CDK)
- Lazy-loaded Angular components

For browser-only functionality, use `panels` and `controls` runtime contributions instead — they are only loaded in the browser.
