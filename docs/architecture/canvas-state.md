# Canvas State

The canvas (`PrismRendererComponent`) is governed by two cooperating services with distinct responsibilities.

## `PrismCanvasService`

Holds the user's globally persisted canvas preferences:

- `bg`: global default canvas background (any `CanvasBg`: `dots | plain | light | dark | checker | transparent`)
- `zoom`, `guides`, `rulers`: set from the floating canvas rail; guides and rulers are toggle buttons on the rail itself, zoom is a chooser in the rail's tools menu
- `viewportWidth`: `number | null`; the width `.demo-wrap` is constrained to, or `null` for unconstrained. Toggled from the rail, set from the **Width** chooser in the tools menu, and dragged from the grips at either edge of the constrained area.

State is persisted to `localStorage` under the key `ng-prism-canvas`. This is the source of truth for the user's preferred working environment across sessions.

## `PrismVariantBgService`

Computes the actually-applied canvas background by resolving a fallback chain:

```
effective = override  ??  variant.bg  ??  component.bg  ??  canvas.bg()
```

- `recommended`: computed from the active component and variant (`Variant.bg` wins over `ShowcaseConfig.bg`)
- `override`: read-only view of a transient signal; set when the user picks a background from the tools menu's **Canvas** group while a recommendation is active
- `effective`: the final `CanvasBg` value bound to the `data-bg` attribute of `.prism-canvas-stage`
- `isDeviating`: computed boolean; true when the override is non-null AND differs from the current recommendation

The override auto-clears whenever the active variant or component changes, so navigating back to a variant always shows its recommendation again.

### Why a separate service?

`PrismCanvasService` owns durable user preferences; `PrismVariantBgService` owns the transient, computed effective state. Keeping them separate preserves the user's global default when they temporarily deviate within a single variant.

## Viewport Width

`viewportWidth` narrows `.demo-wrap` so a layout can be checked at a given width without resizing
the browser. The state is a single nullable number instead of a device list, because the tool is
for finding where a layout breaks. Presets (320, 390, 480, 640, 768, 1024) are named values of that
number, and a drag snaps to one when it comes within 8px. A drag is clamped to between 100 and 1600,
regardless of preset. The floor sits well below any real device so you can find where a layout
gives up.

### The specimen is centred at the container

While constrained, `.demo-wrap` is a grid with `justify-items: safe center` and `flex: none`, so a specimen narrower than
the viewport sits in the middle of it rather than against its left edge. Sizing is unchanged by
this: a block-level specimen shrink-wraps here as it already does at rest inside the
`inline-block` wrapper, and one that asks for `width: 100%` (the `canvasLayout: 'stretch'` case)
still receives the whole viewport.

`flex: none` is required too: the stage is a flex container and `.demo-wrap` is its only item, so the
default `flex-shrink: 1` would render the box narrower than the requested width whenever the canvas is
smaller, and `container-type` drops the automatic minimum size to zero. The stage is `overflow: auto`, so
the box scrolls instead of shrinking.

The `safe` keyword matters as well: bare `center` spills a specimen wider than the constraint equally
past both edges, whereas a real viewport of that width clips at zero and scrolls in one direction.
`safe` falls back to `start` when the item overflows.

The centring uses the container instead of `text-align: center`. The specimen is created through
`ViewContainerRef`, so its host element carries none of the renderer's `_ngcontent` attribute and
no scoped rule can reach it to undo an inherited value. A `text-align` on the wrapper would leak
into the specimen and re-align its text whenever the viewport was switched on.

### Container queries respond; media queries do not

A width constraint narrows a box but does not change what `@media (max-width: ...)` sees, which is
the real browser viewport. A component using media queries stays in its desktop layout however
narrow the box gets. `@container` does respond: `.demo-wrap` carries `container-type: inline-size`
while constrained, so a component written against container queries reflows as it would in
production.

Emulating media queries would mean rendering the component in an iframe, which would take
`plugin-box-model` and every other overlay its target, since overlays render as Angular components inside
`.demo-wrap`. The width constraint is the cheaper option.

### Not in the URL

Like `zoom`, `guides` and `rulers`, the viewport width is a `localStorage` preference and not a URL
parameter. `PrismUrlStateService` carries navigation only (which component, page, variant, view and
panel you are looking at) and no canvas setup.

### Capture mode

Capture mode never restores a persisted width, so a run always starts unconstrained and no viewport
from an earlier session can leak into a baseline. The grips and the dimension line sit inside the
renderer's `@if (!capture.active())` block, alongside the crosshair, the rulers and the background
pill. Capture mode also never _writes_ the width back to storage (`PrismCanvasService.save()` is a
no-op while capture is active), so a capture run cannot corrupt the user's stored preference either.

## Measuring

The measuring tool adds a third kind of state to the two services above: a point, stored in `.demo-wrap`-local CSS pixels, and an overlay drawn as a sibling of `.demo-wrap`, deliberately never a child of it.

### Local coordinates, not screen coordinates

A `MeasurePoint` is recorded via `toLocal` in the same coordinate space `.demo-wrap` itself occupies before its own transform is applied — not in screen coordinates. The distinction matters because `.demo-wrap` carries `transform: scale(var(--zoom))`: a screen-pixel gap between two points on a zoomed-out canvas is smaller than the CSS-pixel distance the component itself renders at. Storing a point already inside that pre-scale space means the distance between two of them (`measureDistance`, a plain `Math.hypot`) is already the real CSS-pixel distance — `formatMeasure` never has to divide by `zoom` to print it.

It also means a pin survives a zoom change instead of being tied to the screen position it was drawn at. `toScreen`, the inverse of `toLocal`, re-projects every point on every render, reading whatever `zoom` currently is; a pin placed at 50% and viewed back at 200% is recomputed from its stored CSS-pixel position, rather than replaying the screen coordinates captured the first time. The alt-hover four-sided readout takes the opposite route to the same destination: `quadSpans` reads screen-space boxes straight from `getBoundingClientRect()`, so `quadLines` divides by `zoom` once, by hand, before formatting — the one place the overlay needs an explicit division, because that reading starts in the other coordinate space.

### Why the label moves at 28px

`MEASURE_LABEL_MIN_SPAN` (28) is evaluated against the _projected_ span — the on-screen distance between the two ticks after `toScreen` — not the CSS-pixel value the label prints. That split matters: a measurement can be a large number and still render as a short line on screen at low zoom, and it is the rendered length, not the number, that decides whether the end ticks and the value can share the space without overlapping. Below 28px the value steps aside, perpendicular to the line, by `MEASURE_LABEL_OFFSET` (15px) — but which side it steps toward is not fixed to one reference point across both callers of `labelPlacement`. The primary drag and pin measurements push it away from the specimen's own centre (`specimenCentre()`); the alt-hover quad readout instead pushes it away from the centre of whichever element is currently hovered (`hover()` computes that centre fresh from `boxOf(targetEl)` on every call). Same mechanism, a different "away from" depending on what is actually being measured — and either way, a short measurement inside a single small component never buries its own number under its own ticks.

### Two coordinate systems, and the projection between them

A stored `MeasurePoint` is `.demo-wrap`-local; every rect the overlay reads — `.demo-wrap`'s own for the projection origin, the specimen's for the label reference point, an element's for the four-sided readout — comes out of `getBoundingClientRect()` and is therefore in _viewport_ coordinates, measured from the corner of the window. Neither is the space the overlay draws in. `.m-svg` is `inset: 0` on the host, so its user coordinates begin at the host's top-left corner, and `.m-label` is placed with `left`/`top` against the same corner. `toHostSpace` is the one subtraction that closes the gap, applied to every drawn coordinate right after `toScreen` and inside `boxOf`. Skip it and the stored numbers stay exactly right while every line, tick, echo, outline and label is translated by the stage's screen offset — down by the header, right by the sidebar — which on a normal shell puts most of the drawing outside the stage. It is a pure function taking the host rect rather than reading one, because jsdom reports every rect as zero and a test routed through the DOM could not tell the subtraction from its absence.

### Where the overlay sits in the stack

`<prism-canvas-measure>` carries `z-index: 1`, and both the floor and the ceiling are load-bearing. It needs one at all because `.demo-wrap` is `position: relative` with a `transform` — a stacking context of its own — and renders _after_ the overlay in the template: at `z-index: auto` the two paint in tree order, `.demo-wrap` wins, and the overlay's marks disappear behind the specimen while its `pointerdown` never arrives, which takes alt-click anchoring with it. And it has to be the lowest of the stage's overlays — below the background pill at 2, the rulers, grips and dimension line at 4, and the toolrail at 5 — because it is the only one that takes pointer events across the stage's whole area: above the pill it covers that pill's Reset button, and above the rail it covers the button that switches the tool back off.

Sitting above `.demo-wrap` is also what makes `elementUnderPoint` read the hit list rather than its topmost entry. The overlay is now the topmost hit for every point over the specimen, so `document.elementFromPoint` answers the overlay itself; `document.elementsFromPoint` and the first entry the rendered root contains gives the element actually underneath. The `contains` guard stays either way, because the toolrail and the grips sit above the overlay and would otherwise be snapped to.

### Core chrome, not a plugin overlay

`<prism-canvas-measure>` sits inside `.prism-canvas-stage` as a sibling of `.demo-wrap`, gated only by `canvasService.measure()` and the same `@if (!capture.active())` guard the crosshair, the rulers and the background pill sit behind — never by which panel is active. A plugin overlay does not have that option: it is rendered as an ordinary Angular component _inside_ `.demo-wrap`, through `NgComponentOutlet` bound to the active panel. Two problems follow from sitting there instead. It is scaled by the same `transform: scale(var(--zoom))` `.demo-wrap` carries, so a label sized at 10px in the overlay's own CSS renders at 5 real screen pixels the moment zoom drops to 50% — the same shrink the specimen itself gets. And it is confined to `.demo-wrap`'s box the way `plugin-box-model`'s own overlay is, whose host sits at `inset: 0` relative to `.demo-wrap` with its own `overflow: hidden`, so a margin box that would extend past the specimen's edge is clipped exactly there. Neither problem is particular to box-model's overlay specifically — both are what any component rendered inside a scaled, bounded box inherits for free, and both are exactly wrong for a tool whose job is comparing two elements that are not necessarily at the same place or the same apparent size on screen.

The deeper reason is architectural rather than visual: a panel overlay is _about_ the active panel — box-model's overlay only makes sense while the Box Model panel is open. Measuring is not about any panel; it is orthogonal to them, chrome for the whole canvas the way guides and rulers are, rather than for one view. `resolveOverlay()` makes that explicit rather than incidental: it resolves to `{ kind: 'none' }` whenever the measuring tool is active, regardless of which panel is selected, and a lazy panel overlay is never even fetched while it runs — the two are never competing for the same pointer. The function's own doc calls this a bridge: once the tool can attribute a measured gap to the CSS property that produced it, the box-model plugin has nothing left that it alone can do, and the reason for keeping them apart dissolves with it.

## UI Affordances

- **Tools menu, recommendation marker:** the recommended background's button in the **Canvas** group carries a tinted border (driven by `recommended()`) instead of a separate glyph. Title attribute: `Recommended background for this variant`. Passive, always visible while a recommendation is active.
- **Canvas pill:** `Recommended: <bg> [Reset]` appears in the top-left of the canvas only when `isDeviating()` is true (actionable; the button clears the override and returns to the recommendation).
- **Tools menu, active state:** the active background button binds to `effective()` and carries the filled `is-on` state. Clicks write to the override when a recommendation exists; otherwise they update the persisted global default (backward-compatible behavior for components without `bg`). The recommended and active buttons can be the same one.
- **Dimension line:** a horizontal rule spanning the painted width at the top of the stage, in `--prism-measure`, with the value set into a gap at its centre and a short vertical tick at each end. The ticks make it read as a measurement instead of a divider, and they mark the two edges the grips can be dragged to. It is the third resident of the overlay band (pill left, dimension centre, rail right) and reads the same `--prism-canvas-overlay-top` as the others, so enabling rulers moves all three together. Its width carries the same `--prism-vp-w * --zoom` product the grips use, so the three stay locked together.
- **Edge grips:** one straddling each edge of the constrained area, each a handle sitting on a faint 1px guide line that runs the full height of the stage. Only the handle is clickable: the line's full-height track is `pointer-events: none`, or it would cover the background pill's Reset button whenever a viewport is on. The handle's hit box is larger than the mark it draws (`background-clip: content-box` over padding), and the same widths are reachable from the **Width** chooser for anyone who cannot hit a 9px target. The line makes the constrained area read as a region instead of two loose handles; it crosses the specimen, so it stays faint and brightens with the handle on hover, drag and focus. The grips run on `prismResizer` with `scale` `-2 / zoom` and `2 / zoom`: `.demo-wrap` is centred and scaled by the canvas zoom, so an edge moving by `d` changes the width by `2d / zoom`, which keeps the grip under the cursor at any zoom level. Both are keyboard-reachable and expose `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax`. ArrowRight and ArrowUp widen by 10px on either grip and ArrowLeft/ArrowDown narrow, with Home and End jumping to the floor and the ceiling. The pointer inversion that lets the left grip track the cursor does not apply to the keyboard, because two separators announcing the same `aria-valuenow` must not move it in opposite directions for the same key.
- **Rail width readout:** a second line under the zoom percentage on the floating toolrail, shown only while the viewport constraint is on. It renders the active width with a `px` suffix (`390px`), since a bare number directly under a `100%` line would read ambiguously.
