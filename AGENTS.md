# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `npx nx build`, `npx nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax

# Linting and formatting

The full picture is in the _Linting and formatting_ section of `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
Three things are easy to get wrong and are worth repeating here:

- **Use `npm run lint:fix` / `npm run check:fix` to fix, never `nx run-many -t lint --fix`.**
  This is the one exception to the "always go through nx" rule above.
  The `lint` target is cached but declares no outputs, so a cache hit replays an
  empty result while the files it was supposed to rewrite stay untouched. The
  command then reports success on a tree it never fixed. The npm scripts call
  `scripts/fix-until-stable.mjs` directly, which additionally loops to a fixed
  point, because neither `eslint --fix` nor `stylelint --fix` converges in one
  pass. Checking (`npm run lint`, `npm run check`, the pre-push hook) stays on
  nx, where caching is correct.

- **`--max-warnings 0` decides whether a run fails, not the severity.**
  Every lint target carries it via `nx.json`'s `targetDefaults`. A `warn` rule
  is just as blocking as an `error`; the severity only controls how loud the
  finding looks in the editor.

- **Formatting is not a separate step for `.ts` and Angular templates.** Prettier
  runs as the `prettier/prettier` ESLint rule there, so one `eslint --fix` covers
  formatting and rules together. `nx format:write` remains responsible for
  everything else (`.json`, `.md`, `.yml`, `.scss`, `.css`, `.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`,
  and the three standalone `.html` documents). The pre-commit hook does both for
  staged files, so a normal commit needs no manual formatting run.
